/**
 * In mathematics, a Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation, usually in two or more unknowns, such that only the
 * integer solutions are sought or studied (an integer solution is a solution such that all the unknowns take integer
 * values). A linear Diophantine equation is an equation between two sums of monomials of degree zero or one. An
 * exponential Diophantine equation is one in which exponents on terms can be unknowns.
 *
 * Diophantine problems have fewer equations than unknown variables and involve finding integers that work correctly for
 * all equations. In more technical language, they define an algebraic curve, algebraic surface, or more general object,
 * and ask about the lattice points on it.
 *
 * The word Diophantine refers to the Hellenistic mathematician of the 3rd century, Diophantus of Alexandria, who made a
 * study of such equations and was one of the first mathematicians to introduce symbolism into algebra. The mathematical
 * study of Diophantine problems that Diophantus initiated is now called Diophantine analysis.
